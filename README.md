# BlackjackProject

# Description:
The Blackjack project is a Java application that simulates a game of Blackjack. Players are dealt cards from a standard deck and aim to reach a hand value of 21 without going over. The project includes classes for players, dealers, decks, and hands, and implements the rules of Blackjack, such as hitting, standing, and determining the winner.

# Tech Used:
- Java: The core programming language used to build the application.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Concepts of classes and inheritance were applied to model the game entities.
- Command-Line Interface: The game is played through a command-line interface, with user input and output.
- Git: Version control system for managing the project's codebase.

# Lessons Learned:
- Object-Oriented Design: Designing classes and their relationships to model real-world entities (e.g., players and dealers) and game mechanics (e.g., dealing cards and calculating hand values).
- Game Logic: Implementing the rules and flow of a complex card game, including handling user input for hitting and standing.
- Code Organization: Structuring the code into classes and methods to improve maintainability and readability.
- Git Version Control: Using Git for code version management and collaboration on the project.
- Command-Line Interface: Creating a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the game.
